  <h2>Ingeridiants</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef </li>
    <li>4 cups tomato-basil pasta sauce </li>
    <li>6 uncooked lasagna noodles </li>
    <li>1 (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese </li>
    <li>2 ½ cups (10 ounces) shredded mozzarella cheese </li>
    <li>¼ cup hot water </li>
  </ul> 
  <h2>How to Cook</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Step 1</strong></dt>
    <dd>Cook beef in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring until it crumbles and is no longer pink; drain. Stir in pasta sauce.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Step 2</strong></dt>
    <dd>Spread one-third of meat sauce in a lightly greased 11- x 7-inch baking dish; layer with 3 noodles and half each of ricotta cheese and mozzarella cheese. <br>(The ricotta cheese layers will be thin.) Repeat procedure; spread remaining one-third of meat sauce over mozzarella cheese. Slowly pour 1/4 cup hot water around inside edge of dish.<br> Tightly cover baking dish with 2 layers of heavy-duty aluminum foil.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Step 3</strong></dt>
    <dd>Bake at 375° for 45 minutes; uncover and bake 10 more minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</dd>
    <dt><strong>Step 4</strong></dt>
    <dd>Note: For testing purposes only, we used Classico Tomato & Basil pasta sauce.</dd>
  </dl> 
  <h2>Chef's Notes</h2>
    <p> This dish pairs well with green beans, mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, salad, or an assortment of roasted vegetables. <br>One could swap out the beef for chicken or sausage, or one could replace red sauce with white sauce. <br>
      Additional cheeses could also be added. When entertaining guests, this could be served with the classic bread and salad combination.
